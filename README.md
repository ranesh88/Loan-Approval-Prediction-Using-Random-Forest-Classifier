# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Classifier
Harnessing machine learning models for loan approval prediction is on the cutting edge of lending technology.Fintech firms are increasingly looking to evaluate a credit applicant’s ability and willingness to repay and speed up the loan underwriting process using machine learning.These kind of models can learn patterns from historical data to predict new loan approvals. They can provide quicker and more data-driven decisions by automating the loan approval process, allowing continuous improvement through monitoring and feedback.

1) Data Collection and Processing:
   ✔ Collect relevant information such as income, credit score, employment status, debt-to-income ratio, loan amount, and historical data
   ✔ Clean and preprocess the data by addressing missing values and outliers.

2) Feature Selection:
   ✔ Identify and select the most relevant features that impact loan approval decisions
   ✔ Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model

3) Data Splitting
   ✔ Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on one subset and evaluate its performance on another
   
5) Model Selection
   ✔ Select an appropriate machine learning model for the task, such as:
        Logistic Regression
        Decision Trees
        Random Forest
        Support Vector Machines (SVM)
        Gradient Boosting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
   
6) Model Training and Evaluation
   ✔ Train the model using the training dataset so it can learn patterns and relationships within the data
   ✔ Evaluate the model’s performance on the testing dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
   
7) Parameter Tuning
   ✔ Optimize the model’s parameters to improve its performance; this can be done through techniques like grid search or random search

Random Forest Algorithm ::

Random forests algorithm also known as random decision forests is an ensemble learning method.  This algorithm is used for both classification and regression. 
For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. 
For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.
